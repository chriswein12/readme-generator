# README Generator

## Description of the application
This is a node.js program designed to prompt the user about their project and provide a completed and formatted README with their answers.

<br/>

## Installation
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install inquirer
```

## How it Works
* The user will start the program with the folling command:
    ```
    node index.js
    ```
* The user will then be asked a series of questions about their github name, email, project title, project description, installation, usage information, contribution information, licenses, and testing.
* After completing the questions, a README will be generated and placed in the "dist" folder.

<br/>

## App Features
* Checks to make sure that information is entered for each prompt to avoid having blank fields in the README.
* A choices list for the licenses that will automatically create a badge on the top of their README with the license being used.
